The morning fog rolled across the valley like a slow-moving wave, softening the sharp edges of the distant mountains.
A single hawk circled overhead, its wings catching the first golden rays of sunrise.
In the meadow below, dewdrops clung to spider webs, transforming them into intricate jewelry suspended between the grass stems.
The world was quiet except for the gentle whisper of wind through the trees—a reminder that even in stillness, nature is never truly silent.
